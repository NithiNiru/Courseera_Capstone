    "It is always interesting to discover what a city makes unique. If you have ever found yourself travelling to a new city, you might have lot of questions looking for similar areas you know of in your place. Or Let's say you are moving from a city to another for a new job and you want to know which area in the city has all the facilities as you live now. This idea drives this project. If you ask me the targeted audience of this project, its the common people and travellers who moves and visits places all over the world.The goal of this project is to compare the two cities, its neighborhoods and its amenities."

    "Each borough has many neighborhoods and each of the neighborhood is been explored using Foursquare API. All the amenities/venues in a particular neighborhood is been captured. Again, the Foursquare API is been used to get all the parent categories. Then the neighborhood venues is been assigned its own parent category. The results are then grouped and categorized to arrive at how many venues of each category(like Food, gym, pub, etc..) exists in a particular neighborhood/Borough. Our final dataset will include borough, Neighborhood, venues, venue-category, venue-parent category and geographical co-ordinates and any aggregate functions which we might use for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used K-Means clustering to segment and cluster the neighborhoods in each city and the results are visualized using MAP MARKERS. Also, BAR CHARTS have been created to visualize the precentage of each category in a neighborhood/Borough.\n",

    "## 4. RESULTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are done with all the data analysis and visualization with machine learning. \n",
    "As per the analysis above, NYC is obviously far bigger, has lot of neighborhoods (306 for 5 Boroughs). As you would have seen above analysis we have taken only first 150 neighborhoods which itself had returned 6677 venues. Whereas Toronto city has 38 neighborhoods with 1706 venues. Considering neighborhood, amenities etc, NYC is seven-eight times bigger than the Toronto City.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the count of categories in the neighborhood (see visualization for reference), we can actually determine that Manhattan is the busiest area in NYC having lots of amenities(which is expected anyways). I am going to take some of the key categories to compare here\n",
    "\n",
    "Food:\n",
    "As expected for any big city, you are going to find lot of restaurants in both NYC and Toronto. But an interesting observation is the proportion of gap between the food offerings and other services is more in Toronto than NYC. That means you will more like have a feeling of noticing lot of restaurants in Toronto whereas in reality NYC have more.\n",
    "\n",
    "NightLife:\n",
    "Known fact that NYC never sleeps but it was interesting to find not just Manhattan but Brooklyn and Bronx have good night life too. This is one thing you will be disappointed if you relocate to Toronto as it have very few options and most of the happening are only in the downtown. So if you planning to take an international honeymoon trip prefer NYC. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other Inferences:\n",
    " - Given the diversity and the size, NYC has best spread on services. From the classification chart you would have noticed the type of clusters and the spread of it in NYC where in Toronto almost all the neighborhood looks similar which is again good in some way. (Note: The machine learning K-means algorithm were able to split the Toronto neighborhoods into 4 clusters and NYC as five clusters based on the dataset we have provided. The marker maps will help you to visualize the clusters segregated)\n",
    " - It was surprising to see Brooklyn handles more or less same amount of shopping and services as Manhattan.\n"

    "## 5. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "As said above in the results section, NYC and Toronto has more dissimilarities than similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more offerings\\services\\options in New York than Toronto. Obviously this implies many factors which you can assume like high cost of living, more transport facilities, more people, ethnicity, etc. This does not mean that Toronto is not having good amenities. The results convey that NYC facilities are astounding. Now it's entirely depends on a person to choose between New York or Toronto. One good similarity is, Toronto is going to offer you almost all food categories that you can find in NYC. "

    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitely the above analysis is of help when analyzing a new location when looking for places/facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "But still there is a LARGE scope of improvement in the dataset. We did not consider one main data entity in this analysis which is People.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Next step would be to \n",
    " - Get the Census data which will help to bridge the gap of people in the analysis\n",
    " - Get the Ratings & Price of the offerings\\products and come up with which is cheaper or costlier when compared with other city. This information will be very handy when you want to relocate\n",
    " - Get the Crime Data and provide the safety rating and compare neighborhood with safety factor which provides same features. With the cost evaluated for the neighborhood already, mapping it with safety would be interesting to see.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most important outcome that I see from this project is, we have to first spend some time in analyzing which cities need to be compared. As in this case we are already aware NYC going to score better in lot of categories but it was fun anyways to evaluate and see that for a fact.\n"
